<h1>General Information</h1>
<p>Muir Woods is a 550-acre (223-hectare) redwood paradise, full of monumental trees that reach as high as 258 feet (79 meters) above the forest floor. Sit and watch as sunlight dances between the branches of these colossal giants that have survived for centuries. The oldest trees are estimated to be at least 1,200 years old.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The coastal valleys of Northern California used to be blanketed with redwoods, but many were lost to logging. In the early 1900s, the Muir Woods nearly suffered a similar fate. It was considered ideal territory for a dam, which would have flooded the trees. Luckily, Congressman William Kent and his wife bought the land and donated it to the federal government. 
</p>
<p>In 1908 president Theodore Roosevelt declared this awe-inspiring area a national monument. It was named after naturalist John Muir whose work helped to establish the national park system.</p>
